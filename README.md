**Tech used:** EJS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose


## Optimizations
In order to enhance the functionality and user experience of the Shelf Control App, the following optimizations are planned for future updates:

Resetting Votes: We understand that sometimes opinions can change or circumstances may require a reset of the voting process. To address this, we aim to add a feature that allows authorized members to easily reset the votes and start fresh.

Vote Modification: We recognize that users may have a change of heart regarding their initial vote. To provide greater flexibility, we intend to implement the ability for users to modify their votes.

Upcoming Meetings and Club News: To further enrich the book club experience, we are planning to introduce an additional page within the app dedicated to displaying information about upcoming meetings, important announcements, and club news. This feature aims to keep members informed and engaged.
